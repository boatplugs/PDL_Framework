# PDL_Framework

Framework for building and testing Procedural Death Labyrinths

My main purpose for this project is to create a PDL framework or engine written in LUA using love.2d
The goal is to have a system that is easily expandable to a full dungeon crawler or similiar games

The framework plans to have support for
-Maintaining and updating a 2d table with level data
-Expandable level generating functions
-Organizing and updating multiple arrays for creatures, items, objects etc..
-Tracking player stats, health, abilities etc..
-Inventory system and item generation
-and other stuff!
